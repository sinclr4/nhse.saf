 Introduction
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The NHS England Solution Architecture Framework (SAF) is intended to describe what good looks like when developing the architecture which delivers our products and services by defining:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A consistent approach to the design of solutions which delivers on user need, but also considers other key factors such as cyber security, service resilience, performance etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The artefacts Solution Architects should be producing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The processes and governance that should be implemented&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As well as describing what areas are important it also provides a baseline to assess the architectural fitness of our products and services. Alongside the assessment it provides a focus for risk mitigation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
